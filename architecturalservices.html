                                Initial design phase of a brief and project sometimes needs professional guidance to 
                                achieve the best outcome, and also paying for professional assistance can and does save money in the long run.
                                <br>
                            
                                Creative designs and High-end projects will take more time in the initial phases.
                                Also, carrying out substantial feasibility studies for new builds at initial stages is an investment which 
                                can bring new aspects to a design and resolve constraints on the site.

                               - Pricing for architectural services will always depend on the size and requirements of the project
                                because of the legal and practical requirements. If however it is a residential extension of permitted planning
                                then pricing packages are available for set standard projects and drawings, and clear service provisions.-
