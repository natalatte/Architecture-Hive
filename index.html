						<h2>////Review Section\\\\</h2>
						<p>*The website looks aesthetically pleasing thanks to the use of CSS stylesheet, the imported font and flexbox within VS Code.* <br>
						   *Trello helped to project manage and keep on track with the development of the website*<br>
						   *The website needs to be more interactive and adding JS or Python would have allowed for this, utilising buttons.*<br>
						   *It could have had navigation to other pages via the images, and perhaps more images on the non-main pages*<br>
						   *The outcome meets the requirements of the brief- text/images/navigation between 3 pages/styled.*<br>
						   *Addition of icon and links to social media would be a good aspect to include*<br>
						   *Logo image needs to be better quality and added as a logo maybe where the diamond icon is*<br>
						   *Drone image and video needed to be embeded and sized appropriately*<br>
						   *
